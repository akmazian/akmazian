👋 Hi guys, akmazian here, welcome to my space station(?).

🪐 Just so y'all knows, the name is stolen from a beloved character and space pirate from PLANETM's [EOS 10](https://planetm.io/eos10/). Go listen to the pod-show!

🧸 Anyways, I'm a sophomore @ UC Berkeley studying Molecular and Cell Biology: Genetics, Genomics, Evolution, and Development with a double major in Data Science on the Computational Methods for Molecular and Genomic Biology emphasis. Go Bears!

🚀 The primary projects I am working on are CalCourse (Full Stack) and the website for Lavender Alliance @ Berkeley (Design & Frontend).

🛰️ My friend said I should do it so here are all the dev tools in my toolbox: Typescript + React, Java, Python, NumPy, PyTorch, and a bunch of other stuff.


✨ While we are at it, here are some classes I have taken: 

- Math: Linear Algebra & Differential Equations, Multivariable Calculus & Analytical Geometry.
- CS: Programming Structure, Data Structure
- MCB: Biophysical Chemistry, Molecular Biology, General Genetics, General Genetics Lab, the Human Genome, Flow Cytometry, Advanced Genetic Analysis
- IB: Quantitative Biology
- BioE: Genetic Design Automation, Machine Learning for Biology, Computational Functional Genomics
