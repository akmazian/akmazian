👋 Hi guys, akmazian here, welcome to my space station(?).

🪐 Just so y'all knows, the name is stolen from a beloved character and space pirate from PLANETM's [EOS 10](https://planetm.io/eos10/). Go listen to the pod-show!

🧸 Anyways, I'm a recent graduate from UC Berkeley now working in the Weissman Lab @ Whitehead Institute (MIT but not really). Go Bears! Go Tech!

🚀 Recently I am working on ... I'm not working on much of anything at the moment. Stay tuned.

☄️ You can find my website [here](azzhang.dev), which, spoiler's alert, will probably end up bringing you back here.
