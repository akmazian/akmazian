👋 Hi guys, akmazian here, welcome to my space station (nerdy vibez). 

🪐 Just so y'all knows, the name is stolen from a beloved character and space pirate from PLANETM's [EOS 10](https://planetm.io/eos10/). Go listen to the pod-show!

🧸 Anyways, I'm a freshman @ UC Berkeley studying Molecular and Cell Biology: Genetics, Genomics, Evolution, and Development with a double major in Data Science on the Computational Methods for Molecular and Genomic Biology emphasis. Go Bears!

🚀 The primary projects I am working on are UW Design Hub and Calavender (sort-of?)

🛰️ My friend said I should do it so here are all the dev tools in my toolbox: some SwiftUI, CS61A-level Python, Data8-level NumPy, some React.js, some broken Java, some Sketch & Figma, and a little bit of Unix command line.

✨ While we are at it, here are some classes I have taken: 
- Math: AP Calculus BC 5, Math 53 equivalent, Math 54 equivalent
- CS: 61A, C88C, 61B IP hopefully
- Data: C8 (that's it so far)
- Chem: 3A, 3B IP
- Physics: 8A
- MCB: 140, C100A IP, 140L IP, 240 hopefully IP
