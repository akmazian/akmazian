👋 Hi guys, akmazian here, welcome to my space station (nerdy vibez). 

🪐 Just so y'all knows, the name is stolen from a beloved character and space pirate from PLANETM's [EOS 10](https://planetm.io/eos10/). Go listen to the pod-show!

🧸 Anyways, I'm a rising-sophomore @ UC Berkeley studying Molecular and Cell Biology: Genetics, Genomics, Evolution, and Development with a double major in Data Science on the Computational Methods for Molecular and Genomic Biology emphasis. Go Bears!

🚀 The primary projects I am working on are CalCourse (Full Stack) and the website for Lavender Alliance @ Berkeley (Design & Frontend).

🛰️ My friend said I should do it so here are all the dev tools in my toolbox: Typescript + React, Java, Python, NumPy, PyTorch, and a bunch of other stuff.

<!-- 
✨ While we are at it, here are some classes I have taken: 
- Math: AP Calculus BC 5, Math 53 equivalent, Math 54 equivalent
- CS: 61A, C88C, 61B
- Data: C8, C100
- Chem: 3A, 3B
- Physics: 8A
- MCB: 140, C100A, 140L -->
